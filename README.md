# Predictive-Models-for-Mobile-Advertising
Generating Linear Probability and Logistic Regression Models to determine how much amount the advertiser will need to pay for placing an ad for different threshold values.
Various publisher and consumer characteristics are used to generate the models. After generating the models, we have calculated total cost per ad with the help of False positives and False negatives.
This gives us an idea which model performs better and what should be the optimal threshold value.
